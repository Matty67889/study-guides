# Study Guides for Classes

## Description

This repo is for study guides that I have created for the classes I have taken.
The goal is to create them in LaTeX. Feel free to use these for your own
studying, but please cite this if you intend to use it as a source for
something.

## Usage

These guides were made to make it easier for people already learning about the
subjects to have an easy reference sheet for important topics in the subjects.
If you are looking for a fundamental understanding of the topics covered in
these guides, you may want to also consult the tetxbooks cited in the guides,
as well as other sources to get a better grasp on the subjects.

## Notes

The content in the study guides are my own interpretation of the subject, so
take all the information with a grain of salt. It is a good idea to do your own
research on the subjects explored in these guides as well to have the best
understanding of the subject.
